## Introduction
Accurate solar power prediction is essential for optimizing renewable energy usage and enhancing energy management systems. 
This project uses weather and environmental data to train machine learning models that forecast solar power generation. 

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing input datasets for model training.
- **Feature Engineering:** Selecting and engineering features to improve prediction accuracy.
- **Model Development:** Implementing regression models for solar power prediction.
- **Performance Metrics:** Evaluating models with RMSE, MAE, and R2 score.
- **Visualization:** Interactive dashboards to visualize data trends and model results.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd solar-power-prediction
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Solar_Power_Prediction.ipynb
   ```

## Usage
- Replace the placeholder data file (`solar_power_generation.csv`) with your dataset in the same format.
- Run the notebook sequentially to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance.
- Visualize the predictions and generate insights using the provided dashboards.
